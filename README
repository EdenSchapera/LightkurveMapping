Each object in the KMZ file corresponds to a target analyzed in Schapera et. al. 2024. The full article text can be found at https://etd.library.emory.edu/concern/etds/n870zs34b?locale=en

The title of each point is the ID number of the object. In each objects description, you will find the classification. Some stars are listed as 'faint', 'bright', or 'no TESS', indicating issues in their classification.
Classification Tags:
RR - RR Lyra
ECL - Eclipsing Binary
RV - RV Tauri Star
Faint - Target was too faint for classification
Too Bright - Target was too bright for classification
No TESS Data - No TESS data for the target region, could not be classified.

In addition, targets that exhibit secondary features to aid in classification are listed with the HC suffix, for "High Confidence"

Finally, the minima variation for each star is given as a fraction. For example, 'MV=0.002..." would indicate minima variation of 0.2%.

Each object was plotted onto Google Earth Pro. In order to visualize these objects, import the KMZ file into Google Earth Pro's sky mapping tool. SDSS data was used to visually verify the position of each star. 
A detailed summary of each object's coordinates, classification, and other important features can be found in Table 3 of the article.

A full description of the pipeline used to generate this data can be found in Chapter 2 of the article. The pipeline code can be downloaded from https://github.com/EdenSchapera/RRcLightkurvePipeline.
